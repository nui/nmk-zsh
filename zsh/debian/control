Description: architecture independent files for Zsh
 Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an
 interactive login shell and as a shell script command
 processor. Of the standard shells, zsh most closely resembles
 ksh but includes many enhancements. Zsh has command-line editing,
 built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion,
 shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a
 host of other features.
 .
 This package contains the common zsh files shared by all
 architectures.

Description: shell with lots of features (static link)
 Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an
 interactive login shell and as a shell script command
 processor. Of the standard shells, zsh most closely resembles
 ksh but includes many enhancements. Zsh has command-line editing,
 built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion,

 host of other features.
 .
 This is the statically-compiled version of the shell, i.e. it doesn't
 require any dynamically loaded libraries to be present and will work
 even if libraries zsh (in general) needs are broken on the system. So
 it's more robust in case of a broken system.
 .
 It though also has a few limitations compared to the normal,
 dynamically linked, e.g. it can't use NSS related functionality which
 might result in minor imperfections like e.g. user names being shown
 in the prompt.
